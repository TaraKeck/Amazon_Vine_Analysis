# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to take a deep dive into the big data to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The reason for doing this excercise is to determine if the reviews are biased.  In this work, there were a total of 50 datasets containing specific products.  For the sake of this project, I chose to evaluate toys.
