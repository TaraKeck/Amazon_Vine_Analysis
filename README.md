# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to take a deep dive into the big data to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The reason for doing this excercise is to determine if the reviews are biased.  In this work, there were a total of 50 datasets containing specific products.  For the sake of this project, I chose to evaluate toys.

## Summary

The analysis reviewed paid vs. unpaid vine reviews and there were a total of 1266 paid and 62028 unpaid reviews.   Within that number of reviews, 432 were paid 5 star and 29982 were unpaid 5 starts.  Overall, the percentage of paid reviews is 34% and unpaid reviews 48%.  The data shows that there is no unfair biases.   Some additional to further test this conclusion would be to continue to dive deeper into the other rating breakdowns to see within this category where the 5 star and under rank.
